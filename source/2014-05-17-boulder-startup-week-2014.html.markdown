Yesterday marked the end of Boulder Startup Week, a five day event celebrating entrepreneurship in our
lovely city (town?).  There were talks such as "The Controversy of Diversity," "Big Data Lightning Talks,"
and "Entrepreneurs for
Good" all day every day from Monday to Friday.  There were also awesome activities on the schedule, such
as cruiser rides, hiking with VC's, and free yoga.  I mean, its __Boulder__ Startup Week, and there
were lots of Boulder-y things for everyone's enjoyment.

Here are some reflections from some of the events I attended this week:

#####Controversy of Diversity

This talk was about, you guessed it, diversity, and specifically the lack of diversity in tech. Although
there was mention of other minorities, it focused on the lack of women in tech.  Being a woman in tech, I
really felt like I wanted to go to this, even though it was at 8am and I had
to wake up extra early and go before class.

The CEO of QuickLeft, Ingrid, gave a talk about how she has
structured her company to be more inclusive of women. She talked about how at QuickLeft they have group bonding events during
business hours, such
as bike days, or cinco de mayo lunches, so that everyone can participate. I liked this idea because at some
companies the only group bonding takes place at the bar after work, and if you don't like to drink or have
a family to get home to, then you probably feel excluded.

She also mentioned how, after realizing that women weren't making it past the first interview round,
but were getting hired elsewhere, she decided to take a look at her company's process. She noted one
particular part, where the interviewee had to get up in front of the interviewer and white board something
in a high pressure situation. She explored the idea that there could be a better way to do it where
everyone could succeed.  I found this to be pretty amazing. I mean, we have all heard the research about
the "confidence gap" between men and women, and that men rate themselves higher than they really are,
and women lower, blah blah blah. However, I feel like every time this research comes up, it is usually
followed up with an implied "so as a woman, just go grab some more confidence so you can be more like a man."
Ingrid's approach seems not to be centered around making women change to be more like men, but in changing
the environment to be more conducive to success regardless of gender.

#####Keynote

I love Boulder.  I mean honestly, how can you not love it? The speakers talked a lot about what
makes Boulder unique.
Boulder is not Silicon Valley.  Which frankly, I am quite thankful for, because I like
being able to afford things (like food) after the rent check clears.
Also, whereas Silicon Valley is known primarily for its tech scene,
Boulder is known for quite a few things.  For example, we are a huge natural foods hub (another reason
I love it here). Are we also known for our tech scene? I don't know, I guess, since I live here. I wonder
what other people think of when they think of Boulder. The speakers asked the audience members who came from
out of town what their perception of Boulder was, and I think someone said something about weed.  Hmm.

#####Big data lightning talks
This was a smidgeon over my head (and by that I mean I probably understood like
 half of the __words__ that were said). Let's move on.

#####Ignite

I'm pretty sure this was the only paid event, and it was totally worth it.  There was a
smattering of random topics by speakers
who had prepared presentations with slide decks beforehand.  The slides advance
automatically every 15 seconds, which added a little extra craziness, as some speakers struggled to keep
up with their slides and some rushed through too fast. I especially enjoyed the presentation about
online dating in Boulder.


###BSW 2014

There was more fun to be had with the Galvanize space opening, the startup crawl, and other events.
Sooooo, see you next year BSW...
