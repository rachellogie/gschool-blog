title: Pair programming is extreme

Here at gSchool, we are pretty extreme. We are all extremely clever
and extremely good looking. We also do pair programming, which
is an extreme programming practice. Pair programming is pretty
much what it sounds like: you pair up with another person, and
you guys write code together. We start out by using our lovely
random pair generator to assign pairs. I really like this idea,
because you get to pair with people you wouldn't normally work
with.

We use Screenhero to share screens, so that both people don't
have to be sharing a keyboard. You can both type on your own
keyboard, but be sharing one person's screen. Screenhero is
awesome like that. We also use git duet to make commits, so
that one person gets the git cred and the other person signs
off on it.

Having a pair is cool for a few reasons. First of all, tossing
around ideas with your pair is great to help get you unstuck.
Your pair also has ideas and ways of doing things that you
might not have thought of, so its great for learning different
ways to do things. And personally, I found having a pair great
to keep me on point, and remind me about things I was forgetting
to do.

Pairing can also be potentially tricky. What if you get someone
who doesn't communicate well with you, or who refuses to listen
to your ideas, or has a huge ego, or wants to type all the time
and won't share the keyboard? I think pairing points out to us
the things we need to work on. For me, I know I tend to want
to drive most of the time, and I have a bit of a hard time
relinquishing control of the keyboard. Wait, wait! I have an idea!
No, seriously, this one is going to work! Structure can help with
this, like one person writes a test, the next person makes it pass
and writes the next test, and so on.

Well, we will be pairing a ton at gSchool, and I am
excited to work with everyone and improve my pairing skills
over the next five months!
