We kicked off day one of gSchool with a crazy day of improv, where we all got to have a little
fun before starting in on 24 weeks of intense coding. The improv teacher was awesome, and he told us at the end of the day
that his assumptions about what a group of software engineers looks like had changed. And honestly, mine have too. We have an awesomely
diverse class. Every person comes from a different background-- we have lots of travelers, lots of musicians. We
have a former oral surgery assistant, a former lawyer, a waitress. I can't think of one of us that fits into the quintessential
programmer stereotype. And, the class is half women (well, 46%, which is pretty close)!

We hit the ground running by diving into GitHub right away. Before gSchool, I had tried to make
sense of GitHub, but had never been able to use it very effectively without the GUI. Within a few days at gSchool I
was able to add, commit, push, fork, clone, and more from the command line. And, the best part is,
I understand why I'm doing each command.

There is definitely a lot to learn and a lot to do. We are working on testing using rspec, which is a brand new concept
to me, and there will be plenty more where that came from. I'm stoked to be spending this summer learning Ruby in beautiful Boulder,
Colorado (where ironically I went to college a million years ago). I am absolutely ecstatic that I get to live here again!

```
g_school = "learning Ruby"
```

The pace at gSchool is intense. You have to get used to uncertainty and confusion. Some of us were used to being good at things,
and now are not good at things :)
One gSchooler made me laugh by putting it this way: "We are getting the
opportunity to polish some of our personality traits-- such as humility."
I'm so excited to be taking this journey, and I'm looking forward to sharing the things I learn with you guys!
