We've spent the past few days diving into Sinatra.  I think its kinda
cute how it says things like "Sinatra has taken the stage on 4567" when starting up
and "Sinatra doesn't know this ditty" instead of a boring 404 page.
But all cuteness aside, I also found the past couple days very challenging. Trying to build
a web app using Sinatra when you don't know a single thing about Sinatra
can be... well... sticky.

Which brings me to the topic of being stuck.  This is obviously
something that programmers deal with all the time. I'm super thankful
to be in a supportive environment like gSchool, where there are people
around to help me get unstuck. Last week I was stuck on some
project I was writing in Ruby. I couldn't figure it out, and I asked
a couple of people who I thought would know, and they couldn't figure
it out either. I felt like the only explanation could be that everything I had previously
thought about how initialize works had been a lie. Just as my entire
mental model of classes and initialize was imploding, the person sitting
next to me leaned over and said "You spelled initialize wrong."
I fixed the typo, and everything worked again.  I was so happy that
he figured it out, I was practically ecstatic. I could finally move
on with my program!

Sometimes asking someone helps, sometimes getting up and taking a break (and
coming back with fresh eyes and brain) helps. I think it also helps to reframe
the situation. In "The 5 Elements of Effective Thinking"
the author suggests making peace with failure as a way to move forward. Something along the lines of "Just say
to yourself, I will fail 10 times before I figure it out" and then, every time you fail, you
can feel like you are moving closer to your goal.

```
== Sinatra/1.4.4 has taken the stage on 4567
```
We just finished the third week at gSchool. It is flying by. We have learned A LOT in such a short
amount of time. Here is a list of things that come to mind right now: git, ruby, rspec, sinatra, gemfiles,
command line, heroku, ports, rackup, HTTP, URL parts, test driven development, and probably a bunch of other stuff
I'm forgetting.
